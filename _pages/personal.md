<p>Some things I fancy:</p>

<h3>Chess</h3>
<p>
I play Blitz Chess online on <a
href="https://lichess.org/@/nickpappu">Lichess</a>. My games usually
begin with the Queen's Gambit, or the Caro-Kann defence. If memorizing
openings isn't your thing, I'd recommend checking out Chess960.

<h3>Music</h3>

I typically listen to progressive rock and guitar-based instrumental
music. A list of some of my favorite albums can be found

<h3>Fiction</h3>

<p>
I enjoy reading fantasy epics by Brandon Sanderson. I'm also a fan of
video games in the strategy RPG and Metroid-vania genres.
