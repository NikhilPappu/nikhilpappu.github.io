<p>Here's some things I fancy:</p>

<h3>Chess</h3>
<p>
I play Blitz Chess online on Lichess. Most of my games open with the Queen's Gambit or the Caro-Kann
defence. If memorizing openings isn't your thing, I'd recommend checking out Chess960.
</p>

<h3>Guitar</h3>

My guitar covers can be found <a href="/personal/guitar/">here</a>.

<h3>Games</h3>

<p>
I enjoy strategy RPGs and retro-themed games. Among my favorites are Advance Wars, Castlevania, and Shovel Knight.
</p>

<h3>Fiction</h3>

<p>Nothing captures my imagination like a fantasy world with its own
history, politics, magic systems, etc. In my opinion, there are few who could pull one off as well as Brandon Sanderson.

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I used to listen to retro progressive rock back in the day.
These days, I mostly listen to modern instrumental math rock.
A list of some of my favorite instrumental albums can be found <a href="http://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=73264&listreviews=rate&showall=true#reviews">here</a>.
