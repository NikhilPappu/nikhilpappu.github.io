<p>Some things I fancy:</p>

<h3>Chess</h3>
<p>
I play blitz games on <a
href="https://lichess.org/@/nickpappu">Lichess</a>, usually starting
with the Queen's Gambit or the Caro-Kann Defence. If memorizing
openings isn't your style, you might enjoy Chess960.
</p>

<h3>Music</h3>

I mostly listen to progressive rock and guitar-driven instrumental
music. You can find some of my favorite albums on my
<a href="http://www.progarchives.com/Collaborators.asp?id=73264&listreviews=rate&showall=true#reviews">Progarchives</a> page.

<h3>Fiction</h3>

<p>
I enjoy reading epic fantasy, especially Brandon Sanderson's works.
I'm also a fan of strategy RPGs and Metroid-vania style games.
