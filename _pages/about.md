<h1>About</h1>
<p>
I am a first year computer science PhD student at Portland State
University. I am interested in the areas of cryptography, complexity
theory, quantum computing, and more broadly in theoretical computer
science. Currently, my research focuses on analyzing the security of
classical cryptographic constructions in the presence of quantum
adversaries.<br> <br>

Previously, I was a computer science undergraduate at IIIT Bangalore.
During my senior year there, I studied secure multiparty computation
and byzantine consensus. I wrote my thesis titled <i> Perfectly-Secure
Asynchronous Multiparty Computation for General Adversaries</i> under
the supervision of Prof. <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/ashish-choudhury">Ashish Choudhury</a>.
