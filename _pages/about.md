<p>
I am a fifth year computer science PhD student at Portland State
University, where I am advised by Prof. <a href =
"https://fangsong.info/">Fang Song</a>. I am interested in the area
of cryptography, and broadly in theoretical computer science.
Currently, my research involves studying the potential and limitations
of quantum information in enhancing classical cryptography.  <br> <br>

Previously, I was a computer science undergraduate at IIIT Bangalore.
During my senior year there, I worked on secure multiparty computation
and byzantine consensus under
the supervision of Prof. <a href =
